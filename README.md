# Crashboard

## Description

Traffic accidents cause more than 20,000 deaths in the US in a year. A lot of these could be prevented if authorities were able to take precautionary and responsive measures in a more effective way.

Crashboard is an interactive web-based dashboard to visualize US-Accidents from 2016-2023 (and beyond with our predictive model!). We use an intuitive 3D Choropleth-based interactive view to show accident statistics and models in an interpretable way so as to enable effective decision making.

This repository contains not only the code to run Crashboard locally, but also Jupyter notebooks containing our complete research methodology and training process.

## Installation

We must first install the dependencies: 

- Clone this repo: ```git clone https://github.com/lordspline/crashboard.git```
- Go into the directory: ```cd crashboard```
- Install dependencies: ```npm install```

## Execution

In order to run Crashboard locally:

- Run the development server: ```npm run dev```

Now navigate to ```http://localhost:3000/map``` to see the 3D Choropleth View.
